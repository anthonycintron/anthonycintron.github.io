      <h1>Solution</h1>
      <p class="row">A digital student-led career and readiness experience. Launched a digital experience which helps kids gain awareness of education pathways and career possibilities that match their interests, increasing access to valuable skill sets, and giving them the confidence that they need to navigate a path to success after high school.</p>

      <br/>
      <h1>Market Research</h1>
      <p>
        EvolveMe was co-created with a nationwide panel of middle and high school teen advisors who provided feedback on design, site features and functionality, UX, and naming, along with quantitative validation based on feedback from over 4,600 additional young people.
      </p>
      <br/>

      <p>
        Like all generations, Gen Z has developed a visual lexicon on their own, which is largely influenced by nostalgia, social media motifs, and playful use of color. All conceptual approaches utilize this visual language to resonate with the youth of today.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <h1>UX Research</h1>
      <p>
        User testing revealed that while most youth found the imagery eye catching, the colors leaned too feminine/childish. We refined our art direction to ensure we hit the mark.
      </p>

      <h1>User Persona Development</h1>
      <p>
        There were three trending types of personas while researching and interviewing students.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Incentive-driven teen—those who lightly engage in self-betterment tasks and are willing to do them in exchange for desirable rewards.</li>
        <li>Validation seekers— those who are already moderately practicing self betterment tasks and want to be able to prove and share their progress with adults, peers, and mentors.</li>
        <li>Self-growth teen— students already heavily practicing self-betterment tasks and seeking accountability and progress tracking.</li>
      </ul>

      <br/>
      <h1>UX Objectives</h1>
      <p>
        EvolveMe gives youth daily building tools to begin their adulthood with confidence. We divided our user experience objectives into three key categories.
