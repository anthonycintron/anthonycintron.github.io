      <h1 class="row">Problem</h1>
      <p class="row">
        Butterfly needed to fully validate their original mission. Which was to deliver relevant and specific learning and development content to millennial managers based on the team's real-time feedback.


There was a product that needed to service its existing customers, and the most significant customer was asking for features that would take many more resources we currently had available. There were tons of opportunities here, but it was not clear which direction would be the most valuable to the business and its strategic direction.

      <h1>Solution</h1>
      <p class="row">Became a personal leadership coach and not just a survey tool. We turned employee feedback into customized leadership training for managers at every level.</p>
      <h3>Design Sprint</h3>
      <p>
        January 2018, we began our first Design Sprint. This would be the first time we decide to tackle the coaching concept mentioned earlier. This was a massive moment for us as a team. The group that participated concluded on a week's long project. We prioritized the problem, chose a solution to prototype, and tested that prototype against our target audience.

      <h3>Chatbot</h3>
      <p>
        We released our first chatbot Spring 2018. We had three companies begin using our virtual coach, who is a bot. Our virtual coach recommended content for managers. It also evaluated the team's cumulative sentiment over several weeks. At the beginning of each week, it would drop a recommendation related to areas such as work/life balance, team collaboration, or manager's support. On the flip side, our bot would evaluate a content provider marketplace for relevant and specific topics that could be shared with managers.

      <h3>Learning System</h3>
      <p>
        We had a learning system that would manage content inventory. Our product was providing clear value, which allowed us to close partnership deals with large media content providers and individual influencers in the mental health and productivity industries. Few months later, we officially released a full-fledged beta to customers we have been prepping for months. At this point, we better understood the value of our new solution, areas we could begin exploring to improve it, and what features or solutions needed to be removed.
