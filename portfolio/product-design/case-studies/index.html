We validated a project-based estimation tool that evaluates historical projects and then forecasts profitability outcomes for new project bids. After conducting dozens of customer interviews, agencies confirmed our tool can actionably help them more accurately generate project estimates.</h3>

Company needed an actionable product strategy which enforces discipline and the completion of short-term goals.
