        <h3 class="title">Truleo</h3>
        <h3 class="shortDescription">Truleo was a true pivot from selling A.I. professional services within the banking industry to deploying a police performance metrics platform for elected officials. The founders hired me years ago to help identify an A.I. product solution for quant investors at major world banks. After customer validaton, we identified banks are not the ideal customer, and quickly moved away to the public safety industry with a enterprise SaaS body-worn camera analytics solution.</h3>

        <h3 class="title">Take The Interview</h3>
        <h3 class="shortDescription">There was a gap between product and engineering leadership. Company needed an actionable product strategy which enforces discipline and the completion of short-term goals. Team was overwhelmed with providing existing customer demands while also building an innovation plan. As a result, too many features were getting built while bypassing the customer and business validation process.</h3>
